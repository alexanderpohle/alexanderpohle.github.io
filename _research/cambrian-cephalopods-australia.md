excerpt: 'This project involves a taxonomic description of cephalopods from the late Cambrian to earliest Ordovician of western Queensland, Australia, together with a major revision of some of these taxa.'

The oldest cephalopods in the late Cambrian are generally poorly studied, partly due to the scarcity of their fossils. In this project, I had the chance to investigate a previously undescribed fauna of cephalopods from the late Cambrian to earliest Ordovician of western Queensland, Australia. The specimens were already collected several decades ago by the late Mary Wade, and are unique in their abundance and three-dimensional preservation, allowing a detailed taxonomic description.

In the first paper on this fauna, we described *Sinoeremoceras marywadeae* and revised the taxonomy of the order Plectronoceratida, showing that due to their unique siphuncle morphology (Fig. 1), they were commonly misinterpreted. We found that the Plectronoceratida is identical with the proposed "Protactinoceratida" and vastly reduced the number of species (from 68 to 11).

These are not the only cephalopods from this collection, so this is an ongoing project.
