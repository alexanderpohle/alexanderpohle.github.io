Hi, I am Alex, welcome to my homepage! 

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Palaeontology at the [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en), Germany in the [Department Sediment and Isotope Geology](https://www.gmg.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/node/79). On this website, you can learn about my past and ongoing research projects.

My research mainly focuses on better understanding phylogenetic relationships of fossil cephalopods. During my PhD at the [Palaeontological Institute and Museum](https://www.pim.uzh.ch/en.html) of the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), Switzerland, I mainly studied Cambrian to Devonian "nautiloid" cephalopods, not only in terms of phylogeny, but also regarding their taxonomy and palaeobiology.

For my current postdoc project in Bochum, I now study coleoids, with a particular focus on the Mesozoic belemnites, attempting to reconstruct their evolution via modern phylogenetic tools. Furthermore, I am interested whether geochemical properties of belemnite rostra can be phylogenetically informative.

In my research, I use phylogenetic software such as [BEAST2](https://www.beast2.org/) and [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/) and further statistical tools in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). I am always interested on how to improve methods of phylogenetic inference for morphological data.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or looking for collaboration.
