Hi, I am Alex, welcome to my homepage! I am a postdoctoral researcher in Palaeontology at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. My rearch mainly focuses on better understanding phylogenetic relationships of fossil cephalopods. During my PhD at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, I studied Cambrian to Devonian "nautiloid" cephalopods, not only in terms of phylogeny, but also regarding their taxonomy and palaeobiology. For my postdoc, I have switched to coleoids, more specifically to belemnites. I am also interested in testing and improving methods for Bayesian phylogenetic inference from morphological character data.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or looking for collaboration.
