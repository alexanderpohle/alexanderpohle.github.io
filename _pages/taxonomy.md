Taxonomy is an important discipline that sets the foundation for a significant part of biological research, yet it is often undervalued and the [number of taxonomists is decreasing](https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlab072). This is not only true for extant biology, but also for palaeontology. Taxonomic names are usually not listed in CV's, although the author's names are an integral part of them. So I think this website is a good place to list all the taxa where I have been involved in naming and describing them.

I list all taxa where I contributed in their first description in chronological order (even if my own part was only small in some cases). All taxa are provided with a very brief characterisation, including its age, provenance and link to the corresponding publication. 

Note that taxonomy is an organic discipline, meaning that names may change or become invalidated by future work, though I will try to update this list as best as possible.

Images are taken from the publication containing the original description of the taxon, unless noted otherwise.

This one belongs to the Pseudorthoceratidae (Pseudorthoceratida, Orthoceratoidea, Cephalopoda) and is named after a preparator at the Palaeontological Institute in Zurich. [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328307395)

4. ***Infundibuloceras kroegeri*** Pohle & Klug, 2018

5. ***Mesonaedyceras obliquum*** Pohle & Klug, 2018  
   Type species of a new genus (see above). A naedyceratid (Oncoceratida, Multiceratoidea, Cephalopoda) from the Eifelian (Middle Devonian) of Morocco. Note that this species is incorrectly spelled as "*M. laterobliquum* in the abstract of the paper, an overlooked remnant of an earlier version of the manuscript. [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328307395)

6. ***Pachtoceras laghdadense*** Pohle & Klug, 2018  
    A potential member of the Poterioceratidae (Oncoceratida, Multiceratoidea, Cephalopoda; the family-level classification of Devonian oncoceratids is a bit chaotic) from the Givetian (Middle Devonian) of Morocco. It is probably the same species that is commonly found in pairs, indicating their [semelparous lifecycle](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59507-0) (i.e., death shortly after reproduction) [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328307395)

7. ***Pseudendoplectoceras angustum*** Pohle & Klug, 2018

10. ***Basiloceras david*** Pohle, Klug & Haas, 2019  
    One of two species of a new genus (see above) belonging to the Acleistoceratidae (Oncoceratida, Multiceratoidea, Cephalopoda), from the Eifelian (Middle Devonian) of Morocco. This species is much smaller than the type species, which is why we named it David. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13358-019-00182-8)

11. ***Basiloceras goliath*** Pohle, Klug & Haas, 2019  
    This is the type species of the same genus as the above species and one of the largest oncoceratids ever recorded, which is why we decided to name it Goliath. It is an acleistoceratid (Oncoceratida, Multiceratoidea, Cephalopoda), probably from the Eifelian (Middle Devonian; note that we stated Givetian as its age in the original publication, but we now have reason to believe that it is actually slightly older, as additional specimens have been found).

13. ***Sinoceras complexum*** Fang in Fang, Pohle, Kröger, Aubrechtová, Burrett, Zhang & Zhang, 2021  
    A straight-shelled member of the Sinoceratidae (Lituitida, Orthoceratoidea, Cephalopoda) with comparatively long septal necks, from the Katian (Late Ordovician) of South China. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1080/14772019.2021.1944354)

14. ***Tyrioceras longicameratum*** Fang in Fang, Pohle, Kröger, Aubrechtová, Burrett, Zhang & Zhang, 2021

22. ***Hemichoanella occulta*** Kröger & Pohle, 2021  
    This species was difficult to place, as it also shows similarities with some species of *Catoraphiceras*, *Notocycloceras*, and *Anthoceras*. We placed it in the Cyptendoceratidae (Dissidoceratida, Orthoceratoidea, Cephalopoda), and it occurs in the Floian (Early Ordovician) of Spitsbergen. [Link](https://doi.org/10.5852/ejt.2021.783.1601)

27. ***Litoceras profilbekkenense*** Kröger & Pohle, 2021  
    This one is a member of the Trocholitidae, (Tarphyceratida, Multiceratoidea, Cephalopoda) and may represent a morphological and stratigraphic link between *Trocholitoceras* and *Litoceras*, both being coiled cephalopods with relatively wide whorls and central to dorsal siphuncles. This species is from the Floian (Early Ordovician) of Spitsbergen. [Link](https://doi.org/10.5852/ejt.2021.783.1601)

30. ***Protocycloceras minor*** Kröger & Pohle, 2021  
    A small member of this distinctly annulated genus that was long seen as the type genus of its own family Protocycloceratidae, but we reassigned it to the Troedsonellidae (Dissidoceratida, Orthoceratoidea, Cephalopoda) instead, based on the presence of diaphragms and calcaereous linings within the siphuncle. It is from the Floian (Early Ordovician) of Spitsbergen. [Link](https://doi.org/10.5852/ejt.2021.783.1601)

31. ***Proterocameroceras valhallfonnense*** Kröger & Pohle, 2021  
    From this species, no endocones were preserved, and therefore, its placement within this genus and even order and subclass (Proterocameroceratidae, Endoceratoidea, Cephalopoda) are somewhat uncertain. However, it agrees with other members of this group in being an orthocone with a very large siphuncle and short septal necks. It is from the Floian (Early Ordovician) of Spitsbergen.

    Another species of the same genus as the previous one (Rioceratida, Orthoceratoidea, Cephalopoda) from the Floian (Early Ordovician) of Spitsbergen, differing in having a circular rather than a elliptically compressed cross section. [Link](https://doi.org/10.5852/ejt.2021.783.1601)

34. ***Maghriboselache mohamezanei*** Klug, Coates, Frey, Greif, Jobbins, Pohle, Lagnaoui, Bel Haouz & Ginter, 2023  
   Type species of a new genus (see above). A cladoselachian (Symmoriiformes, Holocephali, Chondrichthyes) from the Famennian (Late Devonian) of Morocco. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13358-023-00266-6)

37. ***Ticinoteuthis chuchichaeschtli*** Pohle & Klug, 2024  
    Type species of a new genus (see above). Named after a famous Swiss shibboleth ("Chuchichäschtli"), meaning small kitchen cupboard, because it was stored in a drawer in Zurich for many years. From the Anisian (Middle Triassic) of Ticino, Switzerland. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13358-024-00307-8)
